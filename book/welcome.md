# Welcome

Welcome to my cookbook. As the name suggests, this cookbook doesn't contain any recipes to make a good apple pie. Rather, it's a collection of code snippets that solve very specific problems I've encoutered over the years. For example:

- *How do I load multiple `NetCDF` files at once?*
- *How do I place the legend of a `matplotlib`-plot outside of the plot itself?*
- Et cetera

Usually, the frequency of me having to use this stuff is just low enough to make me forget how to do it. Hence, this cookbook serves as a quick reference for me and my fellow MSc students.

As of now, the recipes will mainly be for Python, but this will likely expand as I explore and use different progamming languages.
